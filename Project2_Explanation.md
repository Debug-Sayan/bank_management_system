Explanation:
Product Class:

Represents a product with attributes like id, name, price, and stock.
Functions like displayProduct() to show product details and isInStock() to check if enough quantity is available.
Cart Class:

Manages the shopping cart.
Stores products along with their quantities.
Contains functions like addProduct() to add products to the cart, displayCart() to show the cart contents, and checkout() to clear the cart after a purchase.
ECommercePlatform Class:

Manages the entire e-commerce platform.
Has a vector of Product objects that represent the available products.
Contains functions to add products (for admin), display products, and handle customer operations like adding products to the cart and checkout.
Main Function:

Provides a simple menu for interacting with the platform. The user can view products, add items to the cart, view the cart, and checkout.
Unique Aspects:
ID-based Product Management: Products are uniquely identified using an ID, which simplifies product selection for customers.
Dynamic Product Addition: The platform allows the addition of products dynamically (could be an admin-only feature).
Cart Functionality: The user can view and manage their cart before checkout.
Enhancements to Consider:
Admin vs Customer Roles: Add separate user roles for admins and customers.
Payment Simulation: Simulate a payment gateway during checkout.
Stock Replenishment: Allow admins to replenish stock levels.
This project illustrates core OOP concepts and is a solid base for simulating a basic e-commerce platform.
