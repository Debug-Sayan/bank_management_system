Explanation:
BankAccount Class:

Encapsulates account details (account number, name, and balance).
Contains methods for creating, modifying, depositing, and withdrawing from the account.
File Handling:

Accounts are stored in a binary file (account.dat), and we use file streams (ofstream, ifstream, fstream) to read/write data.
The writeAccount(), displayAccount(), modifyAccount(), and deleteAccount() functions handle different file operations.
Main Menu:

A simple menu-driven interface allows the user to select different operations like creating an account, making deposits/withdrawals, viewing account details, modifying, and deleting accounts.
Features to Consider:
Security Enhancements: You can add password protection for account access.
File Encryption: You can encrypt the data stored in files to enhance security.
Interest Calculation: Periodically calculate and update interest on the account balance.
This project is simple but demonstrates key concepts like file handling, object-oriented programming (OOP), and basic banking operations.
